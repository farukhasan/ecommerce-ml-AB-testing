# E-commerce A/B Testing Analysis: A Statistical Approach

## Overview

This repository presents a statistical analysis of an A/B testing experiment conducted on an e-commerce platform to evaluate the impact of website variant changes on user conversion rates and revenue generation. The analysis employs multiple statistical methodologies, machine learning techniques, and business impact assessments to provide comprehensive insights into treatment effects.

## Dataset Description

The experimental dataset comprises 10,000 users randomly assigned to two treatment groups (Variant A: control, Variant B: treatment) with the following characteristics:

- **Sample Size**: 10,000 observations
- **Treatment Assignment**: Variant A (n=5,016), Variant B (n=4,984)
- **Age Distribution**: 18-65 years (mean=41.52, median=42.00)
- **Session Duration**: Mean=300.3 seconds, with normal distribution characteristics
- **Pages Viewed**: Poisson-distributed with λ=5.062
- **Previous Purchases**: Right-skewed distribution (mean=2.02, max=10)

## Statistical Methodologies

### Primary Hypothesis Testing

The analysis employs multiple statistical tests to evaluate treatment effects:

#### 1. Pearson Chi-Square Test
- **Test Statistic**: χ² = 26.874 (df=1)
- **P-value**: 2.172 × 10⁻⁷
- **Interpretation**: Highly significant association between variant and conversion outcome

#### 2. Two-Sample Proportion Test
- **Null Hypothesis**: H₀: p₁ = p₂ (no difference in conversion rates)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: H₁: p₁ ≠ p₂ (two-tailed test)
- **Test Statistic**: χ² = 26.874
- **95% Confidence Interval**: [-0.0443, -0.0198]
- **Effect Size**: 3.21 percentage points difference

#### 3. Welch Two-Sample t-test (Revenue Analysis)
- **Test Statistic**: t = -6.009 (df=9,602.4)
- **P-value**: 1.939 × 10⁻⁹
- **Mean Difference**: $2.011 (95% CI: [$1.355, $2.666])
- **Cohen's d**: Moderate to large effect size

### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

#### Factorial ANOVA Model
The analysis incorporates a comprehensive factorial design to assess main effects and interactions:

```
F-statistics and significance levels:
- Variant: F(1,9990) = 27.310, p < 0.001***
- Device Type: F(2,9990) = 1.660, p = 0.190
- Traffic Source: F(3,9990) = 3.094, p = 0.026*
- Age: F(1,9990) = 0.659, p = 0.417
- Session Duration: F(1,9990) = 2.008, p = 0.157
- Pages Viewed: F(1,9990) = 3.393, p = 0.066
```

#### Interaction Effects
Two-way ANOVA examining variant × device type interaction:
- **Interaction Term**: F(2,9994) = 2.392, p = 0.092
- **Marginally significant interaction** suggests differential treatment effects across device types

### Assumption Testing

#### Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance
- **Test Statistic**: F(1,9998) = 27.281
- **P-value**: 1.795 × 10⁻⁷
- **Conclusion**: Violation of homoscedasticity assumption, justifying use of Welch's t-test

## Statistical Inference and Conclusions

### Primary Findings

1. **Treatment Effect**: Variant B demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in conversion rates with a large effect size (Cohen's d > 0.8).

2. **Revenue Impact**: The treatment effect extends beyond conversion rates to actual revenue generation, with both metrics showing consistent improvement patterns.

3. **Heterogeneous Treatment Effects**: Segmentation analysis reveals differential treatment effects across device types and traffic sources, suggesting potential for targeted implementation strategies.

The analysis provides robust evidence for treatment efficacy:
- **Point Estimate**: 3.21 percentage point improvement
- **95% Confidence Interval**: [1.98, 4.43] percentage points
- **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.001 across all primary tests
- **Effect Size**: Large practical significance with business-relevant impact

### Model Validation and Robustness

Multiple analytical approaches converge on consistent conclusions:
- **Parametric Tests**: t-tests and ANOVA confirm treatment effects
- **Non-parametric Approaches**: Chi-square tests support findings
- **Machine Learning Models**: Feature importance analysis validates key drivers
- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: Robust estimation confirms population parameter estimates

## Limitations and Assumptions

### Statistical Assumptions
1. **Random Assignment**: Assumes proper randomization in treatment allocation
2. **Independence**: Observations assumed independent (no network effects)
3. **Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)**: Treatment effect on one unit does not affect others
4. **Missing Data**: Complete case analysis assumes data missing completely at random

### Methodological Considerations
- **Multiple Testing**: Family-wise error rate not explicitly controlled
- **Variance Heterogeneity**: Levene's test indicates assumption violations
- **Model Selection**: Machine learning models show limited predictive power, suggesting complex underlying relationships

## Implementation Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive statistical analysis, the following recommendations are supported by empirical evidence:

1. **Primary Recommendation**: Implement Variant B across the platform given consistent evidence of superior performance (35.75% conversion lift, 46.36% revenue lift).

2. **Segmented Rollout**: Prioritize implementation for tablet users accessing through organic traffic, where treatment effects are most pronounced.

3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish ongoing measurement protocols to detect potential treatment effect decay or interaction effects.

4. **Further Research**: Investigate the underlying mechanisms driving the observed treatment effects through qualitative research and additional experimentation.
